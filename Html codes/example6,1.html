                <h3>About BMW</h3>
                <p class="pawq">The official founding date of the German motor vehicle manufacturer BMW is 7 March 1916, when an aircraft producer called Bayerische Flugzeugwerke (formerly Otto Flugmaschinenfabrik) was established.[1][2] This company was renamed to Bayerische
                    Motoren Werke (BMW) in 1922. However, the BMW name dates back to 1917, when Rapp Motorenwerke changed its name to Bayerische Motoren Werke.[3] BMW's first product was a straight-six aircraft engine called the BMW IIIa. Following the
                    end of World War I, BMW remained in business by producing motorcycle engines, farm equipment, household items and railway brakes. The company produced its first motorcycle, the BMW R32, in 1923. BMW became an automobile manufacturer
                    in 1928 when it purchased Fahrzeugfabrik Eisenach, which built Austin Sevens at that time under licence (under the Dixi marque).[4] The first car sold as a BMW was a rebadged Dixi called the BMW 3/15. Throughout the 1930s, BMW expanded
                    its range into sports cars and larger luxury cars.</p>

                <h3>Characteristics of BMW</h3>
                <p class="pawq">The two-part radiator grille, the BMW kidney grille, is the characteristic hallmark of a BMW. It forms the visual centre of the front and symbolises the direct link to the engine – the pulsating heart of every BMW. In the BMW Series, the
                    kidney grille is positioned low, giving the front a sporty presence with its broad form. The kidney grille thus provides a design link to the so-called ‘shark nose’ of earlier BMW models. Now as then, it promises an extra-dynamic driving
                    experience.
